## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- Mobile-first workflow
- Custom CSS
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

### Continued development

I might go out of my way to ensure that this works on more displays than just 375px and 1440px.

### Useful resources

- **CSS Tricks**. Their guide on CSS Grid is invaluable for people either just starting to use it, and even professionals with years of experience in the field. (Yes, even Kevin Powell has to look stuff up from time to time. Everybody does.)
